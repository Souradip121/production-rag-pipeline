The first mission to the moon was Apollo 11, launched by NASA on July 16, 1969. The crew consisted of Commander Neil Armstrong, Lunar Module Pilot Buzz Aldrin, and Command Module Pilot Michael Collins. On July 20, 1969, Armstrong and Aldrin became the first humans to land on the moon, while Collins orbited above in the command module. Armstrong's first words upon stepping onto the lunar surface were, "That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind." The mission was a resounding success, fulfilling a national goal set by President John F. Kennedy in 1961. The crew returned to Earth safely on July 24, 1969.
